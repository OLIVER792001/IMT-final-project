> A "Multimedia Museum Meta Mirror" project exploring the history, craftsmanship, and cultural impact of Chinese ceramics.



## 📖 Project Overview

**5000 Years of Chinese Porcelain** is a "Multimedia Museum Meta Mirror" (MMMM) project representing a digital exhibition of Chinese ceramics history. 

It was created for the course **Information Modelling and Web Technologies** for the **2024/2025** academic year, with **Professor Fabio Vitali**, for the Master's degree in **Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK)** at the **University of Bologna**.

## 🏛️ Exhibition Themes (Narratives)

The museum is organized into three distinct narratives, guiding the visitor through different aspects of Chinese Porcelain:

1.  **⏳ The Timeline (History)**
    * A chronological journey through the dynasties. We explore how porcelain evolved from early pottery to the sophisticated masterpieces of the Ming and Qing dynasties.
    
2.  **⚱️ Craftsmanship & Techniques**
    * A deep dive into the artistic and technical development. This section covers the evolution of kilns, glazing techniques, and the shaping of clay.

3.  **🌏 Cultural Exchange**
    * Focusing on the global impact of Chinese porcelain. We explore the trade routes (Silk Road), the export of porcelain to the West, and how it influenced art and culture globally.
